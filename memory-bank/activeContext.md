# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing the onboarding page with role selection functionality.

## Recent Changes
- Project initialized with Next.js 15.3.4 and Tailwind CSS v4
- Memory Bank structure created
- Project brief established

## Current Task
Creating the onboarding page that:
1. Asks users to select their role (recruiter or general visitor)
2. Stores the selection in localStorage
3. Redirects users based on their choice
4. Only shows once per session (controlled by localStorage)

## Next Steps
1. Create onboarding component with pixel art styling
2. Implement localStorage logic for role persistence
3. Set up role-based routing structure
4. Style with monochromatic black and white theme
5. Add pixel art aesthetic elements

## Active Decisions
- Using localStorage for role persistence
- Implementing role-based routing for different user experiences
- Pixel art theme with monochromatic color scheme
- Step-by-step development approach

## Technical Considerations
- Need to handle localStorage on both client and server side
- Ensure pixel art styling is consistent across components
- Plan for different content routes based on user role
